# Healthcare-And-Patient-Management-Analysis
🔍 Objective: To analyze patient admissions, medical conditions, treatment protocols, and financial trends, helping healthcare facilities optimize their operations, improve patient care, and enhance decision-making.


🎯 Purpose of the Project: To uncover patterns in patient admissions, prevalent medical conditions, treatment protocols, and financial aspects of healthcare. The project focuses on identifying correlations between demographics, medical services, and patient outcomes to support informed decision-making, enhance operational efficiency, and guide healthcare policy improvements worldwide.


Tools & Technologies Used:

📂 Dataset Source: Kaggle.

💻 Technologies Used: MySQL, Power Query, Power BI, PowerPoint.

📈 Skills Applied: Data Cleaning, data transformation with Power Query, data visualization techniques in Power Bi,Trend Analysis, Dashboard Design.

🔑 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Some KPIs identified were:

Total Patients: 55K

Total Revenue: 1 Billion

Total Rooms: 400

Average Billing Per Patient: 25.62K

💡 Insights Generated:

Age Group Distribution: The 36-60 age group has the highest number of patients (20.4K), followed by those over 60 (20.2K). Younger age groups (18-35) have fewer patients, with children (under 18) representing a tiny fraction.

Gender Distribution: Gender distribution is nearly equal, with males at 50.02% and females at 49.98%, indicating balanced healthcare access and needs.

Admission Types: Patients are evenly spread across elective procedures, urgent cases, and emergency admissions, each having around 18.4K patients, indicating consistent demand across healthcare services.

Insurance Providers: Cigna, Medicare, and UnitedHealthcare dominate in patient numbers and revenue, highlighting the diverse distribution of patients across insurers.

Revenue by Condition: Obesity and diabetes generate the highest revenue ($236M each), with cancer, arthritis, hypertension, and asthma also contributing significantly.

Average Billing: Obesity leads in average billing ($25.8K), with other conditions like diabetes and asthma following closely, suggesting high treatment costs.

Recovery Rates: Asthma has the highest recovery rate (17.12%), with other chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity showing moderate recovery.

Revenue Trends: Revenue grew from 2019-2023, peaking at $284M in 2020 but saw a sharp decline in 2024, possibly due to external factors.

Age Group & Medical Condition: The 36-60 age group is the most affected by conditions like diabetes and obesity, while older age groups have a higher prevalence of arthritis and diabetes.

📝 Challenges faced throughout this Project:

Data Quality and Consistency: The dataset required significant cleaning to address missing, incomplete, or inconsistent data, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the analysis.

Complexity of Healthcare Data: The healthcare dataset was highly complex, with multiple variables that needed to be carefully analyzed and interpreted to uncover meaningful insights.

Data Integration and Merging: Combining different data sources, such as patient demographics, medical conditions, and financial performance, was challenging due to variations in formats and structures.

Visualization and Communication: Presenting complex insights clearly and effectively through visualizations that could be easily understood by stakeholders was a key challenge.

Ethical Considerations: Maintaining patient privacy and adhering to ethical standards, including compliance with data protection regulations, was crucial throughout the project.

🌟 Comprehensive Result of the Project:

This project enhanced my data analysis and visualization skills, providing insights into healthcare trends, resource allocation, and patient management. It helped me understand how factors like age, gender, medical conditions, and insurance influence healthcare services and costs, while improving my ability to interpret complex data and present actionable insights for better decision-making in healthcare.
